# Source_Panel_Method
The previously provided pdf contains the theoritical process which is generally used to calculate the the pressure field distribution around an airfoil through vortex panel method and can be get from the provided link(https://github.com/dpkprm/Vortex-Panel-Method.git). But what is unique in the provided process is that it uses discretization of integration into addition rather than using various constants to linearise it which is provided before. It is important to note that the provided code is for source panel method around an airfoil and have a very few amount of inaccuracy.
